				<p class="lead" style="margin-top:0">Wildfires Near Me is a beta web application. It is still under active development. This application should not used as an authoritative data source until the application is officially released to production. <br> <br>This application could experience planned and unplanned outages of varying duration, it may not be fully accessible to all users and the number of users could be capped. Support is currently limited, but your feedback is very much appreciated. For now, enjoy the app and, please, let us know what you think!<br> <br> Many users have requested features that were available last year as well new features. We are currently working on implementing many of those features plus more but no timetable can to be given as to when they will be implemented. Thank you for you patience.
